**NLP Part Of Speech**

This project, developed as part of the Natural Language Processing course at Technion,
employs a Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) along with an implementation of the Viterbi algorithm.
The primary objective is to process input words and accurately predict their corresponding parts of speech.


**The data sets used in this project are as follows:**

• A large training set containing 5,000 sentences along with their parts of speech tags.

• A small training set comprising 250 sentences with their parts of speech tags.

• A test set of 1,000 sentences corresponding to the large training set.

• Two competition files for labeling: one to be labeled after training on the large training set, and the other after training on the small training set.
